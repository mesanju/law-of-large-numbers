Test the Law of Large Numbers for N random normally distributed numbers with
mean=0 and standard deviation=1

Create a Python script that will count how many of these numbers fall between -1 and 1 
and divide that by the total quantity N
You Know that E(X)=68.2% # expected value
check that the mean(Xn) is closer to E(X) as you rerun our script while increasing N.
